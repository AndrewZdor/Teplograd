Teplograd - innovative billing system based on CoreForms Platform

Billing system for heat energy distribution companies built on CoreForms platform. It is used for residential buildings in which bills would be drawn up for each apartment based on actual consumption of heat energy for heating and hot water supply.
A legislative and institutional model of heat and hot water consumption-based metering and billing was developed. This included legislative requirements, institutional scheme, calculation target groups and payment mechanisms, energy metering schemes, proportional distribution of bills to tenants on the basis on heat use and rules for accounting.
